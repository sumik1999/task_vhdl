#####problems faced with nghdl of esim

1. Only std logic and std_logic_vector data types usable not bit
2. vector data type used in nghdl --> coverts to multiple pins in schematic to but on converting from kicad to simulation--> doesn't recognise data type
3. The graphs aren't plotted accordingly even after data on the ngspice terminal is received accurately.
